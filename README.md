# The Takiban Manifesto

> Based on the principles of **Ikigai**, **Kaizen**, and **Mottainai**

Takiban draws from the traditions of Japanese craftsmanship. Much like the careful tending of a bonsai tree or the precision of a master sword maker, this framework values purposeful refinement. Ikigai embodies fulfilling work, Kaizen promotes continuous, deliberate improvement, and Mottainai encourages respect for resources. These values reflect the artistry and discipline found in Japanese tea gardens and woodworkingâ€”creating something beautiful and enduring through patience, skill, and intention.

Progress emerges naturally, without urgency or haste.
